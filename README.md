## Howdy!

My name's Erin (he/they), a simple Bootstrap programmer working with React and Node for dynamic, responsive webpages. I'm just testing out the waters, showing the world what I make through code, and having fun finally putting all of my skills to use making cute websites. If you're hiring, I'm open to front end web development jobs and other opportunities for growth!

#### What I work with:
- Adobe XD for prototyping and experience flowcharts
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 and legacy) for smaller sites for performance
- Bootstrap and jQuery for quick, uniform UI
- SMTP email services, email APIs, HTML-formatted emails via SendinBlue, a great free service for smaller businesses
- React for organized components on larger apps
- RESTful APIs via Redux (currently learning toolkit)
- Thunk and Logger for async requests
- Express, MongoDB and Mongoose for databases and back end APIs
- AWS and Heroku for deployment
- Git and Github for versioning

#### Currently working on:

- Client websites via Bootstrap and Node.js for back end
- Practicing back end JavaScript with Paper Drip
- Learning TypeScript
- Tutorials for how I make my paper sculptures

#### Projects

##### Paper Drip
Front end React app about origami built with Sass, Bootstrap and Redux state management. JSON server is a Github deployment of JSON dev server for quick RESTful API testing and presentation as there is no back end for this project.

##### Tristan Carmichael Website
A quick workflow demonstration using Bootstrap, Sass and Express to serve a static website with form mailing and custom animations. Uses a LowDB database to keep track of user emails to limit them and lower costs. Special thanks to Tristan for allowing me to show off his website!
