## Howdy!

My name's Erin (he/they), and I'm a weird chimera of gamer turned artist turned programmer who...who knows? I'm just testing out the waters, showing the world what I make through code, and having fun finally putting all of my skills to use making cute websites.

Interested in my non-coding stuff? Check out my [Behance portfolio](https://www.behance.net/sherrilh659709ca)!
